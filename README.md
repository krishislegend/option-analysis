# option-analysis

Analysis of option chains. This program gets its information from Yahoo! finance,
so it may be slightly different than an actual trade price.

## How to Install

__Macintosh OS X__: (TBD)

## How to Use

give you the current price of the stock. Then set the expiration date (3rd Friday) 
as well as the Profit points and First Strike price and increment.

Then click the refresh button to get the six (6) options analyzed.
